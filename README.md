### Hi there I'm Drew, a full-stack developer and Co-Founder of **Sitekick**. :ninja:

Most of my experience is with full-stack web development however I like to stay up-to-date in all areas of software. My next goal is to dive into compsec :detective:.

Reach out to me if you have any questions or are considering building something. I am always open to helping people build new things.:rocket: 

#### Personal

I am a big believer that software development needs to be fluid. This means using the right tool for the right job and educating clients in terms of the benefits of any given language/stack. As such, I don't normally recommend ***MERN*** for my projects by default (*even though I love the stack*).



Here are some languages I have been using lately on the frontend:
